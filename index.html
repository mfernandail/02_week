		<h2>Learning semantic HTML</h2>
		<p>
			This week I learned about semantic HTML and the importance of using the correct tags to structure a web page.
			I understood that using elements, not only improves the readability of the code, but also enhances accessibility, SEO, and how browsers and search engines interpret the site.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also learned about the importance of using the correct tags for different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
			This helps to create a clear and organized structure for the page, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.
