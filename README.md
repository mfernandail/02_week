# Week NÂ° 2

## Step by step, line by line â€” becoming a Full Stack Developer in one year.

### This week I dive deeper into CSS (Box Model, display) and JavaScript by manipulating the DOM and events, building an interactive card to apply these concepts.

âœ… HTML

- Improved structure for accessibility and SEO.

âœ… Basic CSS

- Display types like `block`, and `inline-block`.
- Styled the card with colors, borders, centered elements, and `:hover` effects.
- Applied clean visual design practices.

âœ… JavaScript

- Introduction to the DOM: selecting elements, handling events, and manipulation.
- Show/hide content with button clicks.
- Add and remove classes dynamically using `classList`.

## ðŸ’» Mini project of the week:

I built an interactive card using semantic HTML, custom CSS styling, and JavaScript to add behavior. A button toggles between two descriptive paragraphs. I also added styles like centered layout, colors, rounded borders, and hover effects.
